This package 'covBM' is a reworked version of a package submitted under the name 'corBM' earlier in the year (19/02/2015). The previous package was not compatible with CRAN policies and so was rejected. However, the new package 'covBM' has been restructured to avoid the problems present in the initial submission to CRAN.
